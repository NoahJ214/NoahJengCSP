For this question, I was thinking in a computer-science focused way, where all problems can be solved with an algorithm. However, there are many problems that expand beyond the realm of computer science that can't be solved with a single algorithm. 

-Question 14

When the heads counter=2, it means that the tails counter also has to equal 2, therefore the same number of heads and tails have been flipped.
