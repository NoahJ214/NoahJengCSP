### Introduction on our project
Our data structures project is for a club called TrailNorte. It is a club that is dedicated to cleaning up trails around the area. We are planning to make our website a club management website, which will better help the leadership of the club organize events and recruit more members to the club. We will have a roster page that will list all of the members, their hours, as well as upcoming events that they can attend.
