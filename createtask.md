I was thinking of doing something like a quiz or survey that the user can interact with. It will be similar to the pair/group create task that we did last tri. 
We did a sports image quiz, where you guess different sports teams based on their logos. For my college board create task, I want to do something similar to this, however not based on sports.
I want to make it on a more useful topic, such as current world issues. I will use a similar format to the imageQuiz.
